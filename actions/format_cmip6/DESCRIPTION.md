# Format CMIP6 Data

The .yaml file in this directory was used to format CMIP6 univariate data for usage in PCEX and the PDP. It adds a couple of CMIP6-specific attributes (`project_id` and `product`) and renames several attributes in accordance with the PCIC Metadata Standards. This file was used with the `update_metadata` script in the `climate-explorer-data-prep` repository.
