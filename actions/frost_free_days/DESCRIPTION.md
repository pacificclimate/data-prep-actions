# Frost Free Days

This script is passed an input directory and an output directory. It opens every file in the input directory. If that file has a frost days variable (`fdETCCDI`) it creates a version in the output directory that has frost free days (`ffd`) instead. In other respects, the files are identical, with the same dimensions,  non-frost-related variables, and metadata except variable metadata, and an update to the `history` attribute. The frost free day file will have the same name as the frost day file, but with `ffd` substituted for `fdETCCDI`.
