# To test different version number (1.1.1 vs 1.3.0) specifications in
# requests

# Error InvalidDimensionValue (for time) appears to be provoked by
# requesting a map layer for the following parameter combinations:
#   variable_name: pr, year: 2025,  timescale: monthly, month: jan.
# No other combination of parameters provoked this error.
# Later runs with the same parameters provoked no error.
# Hence this error is transient.

# Similarly, these requests sometimes provoke the error LayerNotFound.
# This seems to have happened more often, but the response is transient
# as well, as demonstrated by two successive runs of the below
# parameters, one getting 1 such error and the second getting none.
